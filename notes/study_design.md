# Study Design 
## Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Reseach 
**Confirmatory**: Scientific method whereby you specify a falsifiable hypothesis, and then test it. You are collecting the data to address a single pre-specified question. 

**Exploratory**: Collect and analyse the data without first setting a question that you are going to investigate. 


##Â Comparative Research Studies
One main theme that you will find in these studies is the idea of a comparison between two methods, where you are trying to see whether a particular element impacts another metric. 


## Non-comparative Research Studies
The focus here is to estimate or predict absolute quantities. 

# Data Collection
## Observational 
The data arrives 'naturally' and you have to split the units into groups yourself.  


## Experimental 
Involves the manipulation or assigment of different conditions to different units. This way we can compare the outcome of the manipulation on the collected result.  

## Power Analysis 
This is the process that you use to assess whether a given study design is likely to yield meaningful findings. 

## Bias 
Measurements are systemically off-target, or the sample that you've taken is not representative of the population that you rae trying to make inference about. *Observational studies are slighly more vulnerable to this (selection bias).*
