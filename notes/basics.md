# What is Statistics? 
A statistics is a numerical or graphical summary of a collection of data. The field of statistics, however, is an academic discipline focusing on research methodology. 

Properties of statistical studies are constantly evolving, about when they are the best used. Subject matter is incredibly important and knowing the source of the data changes how you interpret it. 

### Summarising Data 
Large amounts of data can be overwhelming to comprehend, reducing this can improve the ability to interpret the data set. You can summarise the data to describe it in a way that portrays what you are trying to say to the consumer. 

### Uncertainity 
Statistics provides a framework to assess whether claims made on data are meaningful. Uncertainity is inevitable but it is a desirable skill to be able to report how far our findings fall from 'the truth'. Margin of error is one such metric that aims to measure the discrepancy between reported and actual statistics. 

### Decision-making 
By leveraging the statistics and uncertainity we can use that to make decisions, whether that be applied to business or medical or whatever setting. What are the costs and benefits of different approaches, and how can data and statistics help with making those decisions?

### Variation
There is a great deal of time spent looking for the central value and the variation of a distribution. We can combine and improve our knowledge of the true distribution by taking into account the samples that we have. 

### Forecasting 
With a good use of data and statistics, we are able to forecast a likely outcome using what is known to us. 

### Measurement 
There are some things that can be measured very accurately and do not change, but other variables fluctuate and others are subjective and very difficult to measure. There is a major role in constructing and evaluating rigorous approaches for measuring difficult-to-define concepts and assessing the quality. 

### Data Collection
If there are issues with data collection, particularly quantity, then you may be able to work out the size of the data required to make reasonable assumptions about the population; this can save money and time in some environments.  

### Cluster Sampling  
You select a random sample of clusters, and then within those clusters you then sample randomly again to create your dataset. This is done with medical surveys where you cluster randomly geographically and then randomly within the selected areas.
