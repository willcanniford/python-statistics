# Data Origin   
Where does the data that we are using come from? 

## Organic / Process Data
This data is created and collected organically over time, and is the result of something organic happening and us collecting that as it does so. Financial data that is recorded, and transactional data are examples of this type of data as an organic prcoess happens and we are collecting the information alongside the interaction. 

Sporting events are another example of these data sets, the events are happening regardless and there is someone out there that is recording the outcomes either at team or personal level. These data sets can be very large and be used to infer trends within the data. 

Geographical data sets that track temperature and pollution also fall into this category of data. 

Understanding where the data comes from may change the way that we statistically look at it. Data scientists can uncover trends in this large data and find interesting relationships that may be within the data. 

## Designed Data Collection 
This is designed specifically to tackle a research topic or question. Individuals may be interviewed from a give population and then asked designed questions about a particular topic to build a data set. 

This generally revolves around taking a subset of the population and then designing some process that works on that subset in a particular way before inferring something about the population as a whole. 


## Are the data i.i.d.?
Is the data **independent** and **identically distirbuted**?
All the observations are independent of all the other observations and all the values that we are looking come from a common statistical distribution. 

### What is the data aren't i.i.d.? 
If students that sit next to one another have similar scores, or if males and females have different means for their distributions, or students from same discussion section have similar scores are all examples of how the observations may not be independent, as the result varies depending on another factor. 

Depending on the above, you may need to perform different analytics processes depending on the distribution etc.
